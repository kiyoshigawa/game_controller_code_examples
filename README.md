# game_controller_code_examples

This repo is for the code examples from my Making Video Game Controllers with Teensy class.
Slides from the class are here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HD-jwH0Dab6GctrBTf3uvarwtBUZJixPH2aPoenfoRI/edit?usp=sharing
I also put a pdf of the slides in the git repo.

I'll also post the youtube video link of the class here once it's uploaded.
